Hi. I am Pooja Sharma. I have been a programming enthusiast since my first code in BASIC language. My earliest exposure to Software Engineering was during a summer programme called Catch Them Young 🎓, where a group of school students pan India were selected to attend lectures by the founder of Infosys Mr. N.R. Narayana Murthy.  

After college, I had joined PricewaterhouseCoopers as Technology Consultant 👩‍💻. I took a detour from this path when I joined Punjab National Bank as Assistant Manager (Bank PO) 🏦. I spent another 4 years preparing for UPSC Civil Services during which I wrote 3 mains and 1 interview of OPSC 📚.

During this time, I started developing [websites](https://github.com/Shailaputri?tab=repositories) and creating [content](https://myessaycollection.wordpress.com/) on topics that I read. I have developed two full-scale web applications (Geoflashcards and Book Inventory App) using Python's full stack Django framework. 

While developing applications was fun, I realised that it was only a start. The application would collapse without a strong backend design and exception handling, and adding new features to it was difficult without a good modular code. The code should be able to scale itself as well. All these ideas got me started towards the need to upskill in backend software engineering. 


⏩ to the present : I am pursuing a Certification program at [Scaler](https://www.scaler.com/academy/profile/50073e503ef1/) in Software Engineering. 

On the personal front, I am mother of one year old. I am a stay-at-home mother taking care of my child's needs and ensuring that my child feels loved, nourished and secure. I cook my own food as it has the highest compound effect on our health. I am a yoga enthusiast and an early riser. Work-life balance is important to me.

Short summary of my work:  
--> Python programming language 🐍- I am in awe of the Zen of Python and its multiutility across web development, data analysis and scripting. I have used its modules collections to code with deque, libraries Dash for web development, Numpy and Pandas for data analysis, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation.    
--> Django framework 🚀- I developed webapps for online marketplace and AIChatbot (using OpenAI API). I am still working on few others like Learning Management System and Storyboard. I am also developing clone of websites like Stackoverflow that helps me to understand the design behind these websites.   
--> Scrapy framework 🕷- I used this for scrapping a basic bookstore site to collect information on book prices and reviews. This was part of a freelance project for second hand books e-marketplace.    
--> SQL Database, Postgres SQL   
--> Wordpress 🌐- Developed personal website using oceanWP theme.    
--> Data Structures and Algorithms - I have solved 500+ problems. They cover different Data structures like hashmap, hashset, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees. I have developed algorithms to solve these problems within provided time and space constraints. [Scaler profile](https://www.scaler.com/academy/profile/50073e503ef1/)&nbsp;&nbsp;     
--> Java - Learnt OOPs concepts and design patterns through this. 
--> Springboot - Scaler projects using this framework. 
--> C/C++ - My elective in higher secondary school and college.
