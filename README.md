Hi. I am Pooja Sharma. I have been a programming enthusiast since my first code in BASIC language. My earliest exposure to Software Engineering was during a summer programme called Catch Them Young, where a group of school students pan India were selected to attend lectures by the founder of Infosys Mr. N.R. Narayana Murthy.  

After college, I had joined PricewaterhouseCoopers as Technology Consultant. I took a detour from this path when I joined Punjab National Bank as Assistant Manager (Bank PO). I spent another 4 years preparing for UPSC Civil Services during which I wrote 3 mains and 1 interview of OPSC.

In my free time, I started developing websites and creating content on topics that I read. [My blog](https://myessaycollection.wordpress.com/)    


Short summary on my work:  
--> Python programming language - I am in awe of the Zen of Python and its multiutility across web development, data analysis and scripting. I have used its modules collections to code with deque, libraries Dash for web development, Numpy and Pandas for data analysis, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation.    
--> Django framework - I developed webapps for online marketplace and AIChatbot (using OpenAI API). I am still working on few others like Learning Management System and Storyboard. I am also developing clone of websites like Stackoverflow that helps me to understand the design behind these websites.   
--> Scrapy framework - I used this for scrapping a basic bookstore site to collect information on book prices and reviews. This was part of a freelance project for second hand books e-marketplace.    
--> SQL Database, Postgres SQL   
--> Wordpress - Developed personal website using oceanWP   
--> Data Structures and Algorithms - I have solved 500+ problems. They cover different Data structures like hashmap, hashset, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees. I have developed algorithms to solve these problems within provided time and space constraints. [Scaler profile](https://www.scaler.com/academy/profile)&nbsp;&nbsp;
